# Example 0: SDN Intro

## Mininet

- Get an idea about what mininet (http://mininet.org/) does and how it can be
  used to experiment with SDN.
- Start mininet using `sudo mn`.
- Experiment with the following commands:

```
mininet> help

mininet> (dump | net | nodes | links | ports)
mininet> h1 (ifconfig | arp | route | tcpdump | ...)
mininet> pingall
mininet> h1 ping h2
mininet> iperf h1 h2
mininet> link s1 h1 (down | up)
```

- Stop mininet by using `exit`. You can also cleanup previous mininet runs by
  using `sudo mn -c`. See `sudo mn --help` for further options.
- Start mininet for different topologies:

```
sudo mn --topo single,4
sudo mn --topo linear,4
sudo mn --topo tree,depth=2,fanout=4
```

- How is mininet related to Software-defined Networking?
- How does a typical SDN architecture look like and what role do switches and
  controllers play?

## Using mininet together with an SDN controller

- Start mininet using the custom topology defined in OpenFlowTopo.py.

```
sudo python OpenFlowTopo.py
```

- Why do you get a warning regarding missing connection to 127.0.0.1:6633?
  Examine the code in OpenFlowTopo.py.
- Get an idea about what ryu (https://ryu-sdn.org/) does and how it can be used
  to experiment with SDN.
- Start the ryu controller together with the provided OpenFlowApp.py

```
sudo ryu-manager OpenFlowApp.py
```

- Change the OpenFlowApp.py to install flows that enable ping (ICMP) between the
  hosts in the topology. Hint: Ethertype IPv4 = 0x0800 and Ethertype ARP =
  0x0806.
