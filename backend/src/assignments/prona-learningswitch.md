# Example 3: Learning Switch (L2 Forwarding incl. Flood & Filter)

## Background

This lab is based on the [p4-learning](https://github.com/nsg-ethz/p4-learning)
environment. You can find further details regarding the implementation of a
learning switch in the corresponding
[exercise](https://github.com/nsg-ethz/p4-learning/tree/master/exercises/04-L2_Learning)
by NSG-ETHZ.

## Implementing a Learning Switch

- Switch forwards Layer 2 frames, based on destination MAC address, learned from
  received frames source MAC address
- Flood & Filter functionality of a typical Layer 2 switch
  - Source MAC addresses from received packets should be learned (i.e., inserted
    in the MAC address table as future destinations) referencing the ingress
    port
  - If destination MAC address is not in the table or multicast/broadcast
    addressis used, flood the packet to all other egress ports (excluding the
    ingress port)
  - If destination MAC address is in the table, only use the egress port
    referenced in the table entry to forward the packet

        P4-Switch---H3;
```

```
H1 @ Port 1 of P4-Switch, MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:01
H2 @ Port 2 of P4-Switch, MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:02
H3 @ Port 3 of P4-Switch, MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:03
```

## P4Runtime / Control Plane

- We already implemented the Flooding (Broadcast) and Filtering (MAC address
  table) in the static switch
- How can we implement the learning part?
  - Learning was manually carried out using the CLI to add a table entry
  - CLI, API, gRPC etc. could be used to automatethis manual process (e.g.,
    using a Python program)
  - This leads to the implementation of a smallControl Plane App to change
    switch config/logicduring runtime
  - We'll use the CPU port to inform our App, thata new MAC address was seen and
    insertinga new entry for this address in the table

## Extending the minimalistic switch to become a learning switch

### Add an additional srcMacAddr table

- Add a table to learn source MAC address, idea: if incoming source MAC address
  is already in the table -> do nothing (NoAction)
- if MAC address is not in the table, learn it by cloning the packet from
  ingress to egress (I2E) and sending it to the CPU port (using a port mirror in
  the switch)

### Add a new CPU packet protocol to be used to send learned MAC addresses to controller

- Use a custom CPU header to packets to controller via CPU port (containing MAC
  address to learn on ingress port)
- Be sure to add the cpu header to the deparser to include it in the outgoing
  packet

## Implement a controller app (learning_switch_controller_app_p4-learning.py)

- Implementation of a Python App on Control Plane using P4Runtime
- Uses Switch API to execute RuntimeCmds (which we did manually before), hence
  configuring table entries, multicast groups and mirror sessions during runtime
- Uses scapy to sniff on CPU port and use received packets (using the defined
  CPU header) to learn new MAC addresses and inserting them in the tables

### Initialization

- Upon initialization of the LearningSwitchControllerApp class, establish
  connection to Switch in running topology (uses p4-utils of nsg-ethz)
- Add mcast groups to switch
- Add mirror session (to mirror packets to the CPU port) to the switch

### Adding mcast group and mirror using API instead of CLI

- Add mcast groups to switch using API, this is what we did manually before by
  using `mc_mgrp_create`, `mc_node_create` and `mc_node_associate`
- Add mirror session (could also be done manually using the CLI)

### Receive incoming CPU packets from mirror and add learned MAC addresses to srcMacAddr and dstMacAddr table

- Continuously sniff for packets on cpu port interface and treat received
  packets as information to learn about new mac addresses on ingress ports
- Add learned MAC addresses and their ports using switch API for table_add

## Task 1: Start controller

- Start the controller and see how it learns MAC addresses
- Start a ping from H1 to H2
- Are any packets sent from H1 to H2 also received by H3? Which ones? Why?

## Task 2: Remove learned MAC addresses from dstMacAddr table

- Remove all entries from dstMacAddr table
- Start a ping from H1 to H2 again
- Are any packets sent from H1 to H2 also received by H3? Which ones? Why?

## Discussion of ProNA P4 Learning Switch and possible next steps

- Switch forwards Layer 2 frames, based on destination MAC address
- Implements flood & filter function of typical Layer 2 switch
- Broadcasts and packets going to unknown unicast MAC addresses are flooded to
  all ports except the port that the packet arrived on, try to comment out
  table_add to see every packet being flooded... same holds true when table is
  full... same for real-world switches...
- Packets destined to known unicast MAC addresses are forwarded only to the
  learned ports
- Implementation is still very basic, compared to real-world switches
- No "delearning"/aging of table entries, no VLANs, ... etc.
- Yet, now we saw all essential ingredients to implement more
  sophisticatednetwork elements and their functions
