# Into the SDNverse – Demo Version

## Overview
This is the demo implementation of the **Into the SDNverse** project.  
The platform explores the use of gamification in computer lab environments, where students can select an **avatar** and a **HEXAD-based role** (e.g., Socializer, Achiever, Explorer, etc.) before starting their exercises.  

## Current Demo Behavior
**Note:** In the current demo state, role and avatar selections are not yet connected to differentiated lab experiences.  
- No matter which **role** or **avatar** a student chooses, the system will always redirect to the view of a **default Socializer page**.  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run **npm run dev**
3. Now you can click through the demo

## Disclaimer
This demo is a **prototype**. It does not yet represent the full gamified learning experience. The purpose is to illustrate the **concept** and basic **user flow**.
